What is a L1nK file? 

A L1nK file is a file that allows quick file-based saving of URL's.
Helpful for saving things like associated URLS within a folder.

Use Cases:

Reference Code Project: {
	item1: Code Folder + Contends,
	item2: Project Wallpaper,
	item3: L1nK file*
}

* As opposed to saving it as a Txt file, where the user needs to open it, select all copy, then open the browser of choice then paste, this allows 1 click to open. 1 click to save (With my lightweight Menubar App called "L1nK")
